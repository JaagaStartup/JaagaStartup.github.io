> Coworking is about people, not space. It's about collaboration, not cubicles. It's about the journey, not the destination.

We are a curated entrepreneurial community who share skills, networks and knowledge. Within a well laid out coworking space with high speed internet, we collaborate and help each other build stronger ventures.

{% include alert info='Try us for day. Free. Wednesdays (skill sharing) and Fridays (social chai) are highly recommended!' %}
