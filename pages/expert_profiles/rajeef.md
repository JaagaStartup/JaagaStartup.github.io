domain_explanation: "Early stage entrepreneurs would benefit from technology inputs because some of the problems they're trying to solve or the experiments they're trying to run, could be accelerated by putting together existing piece of technology rather than reinventing them.
For those who already make use of technology, a nudge in the right direction would save hours of time spent on development cycle, which is a precious commodity for startups."
